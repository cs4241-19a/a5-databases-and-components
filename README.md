## Best Movies, In EMOJI

your hosting link e.g. https://a5-ncarvajaerker.glitch.me/

I used REACT to add an emoji search. So when the user inputs a movie title, emojis will popup to replace it. There is a database of emoji images and key words it links it to that allow for this to occur. before with the movie list you could just add a name to the list but now you are able to type a name and have each word be replaced by images.
