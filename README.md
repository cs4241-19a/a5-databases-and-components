This project was a continuation of Assignment 3 (github.com/ciduarte/a3-persistence).

My project was inspired by a restaurant in Cambridge, MA called Yume Wo Katare.
The only thing on the menu is a bowl of ramen, and you get to choose how many pieces
of pork you'd like. Before starting the meal, customers are encouraged to share their
dream with the chef.

My website features an order form and a table to view all of the orders fetched from
the server. Within the table, you can edit or delete entries from MongoDB.
My previous iteration of this project leveraged lowdb. Integrating MongoDB into my project
felt seamless. I enjoyed it's ease of use, and found it more user friendly than lowdb.
