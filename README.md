I added React to the two pages I designed for a3. I created two classes extending react.component and these classes delivered the entire page as a react component. I rendered the 
components using jsx. Because of the extremely convoluted and complex structure of the html and the css files, I stayed away from adding minute react components for each and
every DOM element. Use of react does make it a lot easier to generate web pages because everything can be put inside a javascript file, allowing you to edit a react component's html,
js and css aspect. I had a lot of issues with hosting the actual react element. I used npm and the instructions on parcel.
