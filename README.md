## Booker 2.0 (A3, with MongoDB)

http://a5-christopher-mercer.glitch.me

All changes made for this assignment were in the back end. So while it may look the same, the database management system is now MongoDB instead of SQLite.

I found MongoDB about the same as using SQLite in terms of implimentation ease and syntax. However, there are clear benefits to MongoDB in terms of scaling. For this reason, I think I would be more likely to use it on a project in the future compared to SQLite.
