## My Travel Dictionary App v3

http://a5-jrbartone.glitch.me

The new technology integrated into this app is Mondo DB. This decision both helped and hindered the development experience. Data is now stored on the cloud and not locally, which is cool. 
Retroactively changing the backend on the application was not cool. Also, everything takes a long time because you have to interface with an online server. 

The data is still shy and might need a refresh to show up. Also, things are slower because of calls to Mondo, so be patient with my baby. Thanks!
