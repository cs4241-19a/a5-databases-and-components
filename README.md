## To Don't

The new technology used was React for the rendering of the table on the main display page. This was very helpful for the development once the environment was set up. Due to this being a pre existing project I used the inline development version of Babel instead of building correctly. Once set up it was nicer to use as a react component than just appending entries using pure JS.

This application already used a cloud NoSQL DB (AWS DynamoDB) so that wasn't added for this assignment.
