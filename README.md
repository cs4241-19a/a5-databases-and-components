My project is an online to-do list. Users can, make an account, log in, and then add, delete, and modify items on their to-do list. I implimented choice #1, and added MongoDB with Mongoose support to my project. 
  
The new technology improved the development experience. I had a lot of trouble with lowdb lagging, and this did not have any issues. It was also much easier to find things (the syntax seemed more straight forward), and I was able to keep user authentication.
