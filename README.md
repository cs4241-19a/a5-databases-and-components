Changes I have made to my A3
---
- I used MongoDB to replace lowDB. The "add" and "login" work but "modify", "delete" and "register" are no longer supported just because of the amount of time I have. Also for some reason the new entry does not get populated into the table right away after "submit", you need to click "update" (and nothing will get updated ofc) before the new entry can show up in the table. 
- Professor confirmed in class even only one or two components are working it should be fine with this project, so I am turning it in although not everything is fully functional.
- You now have to use the pre-existing account to test out the login functionality: username: admin, password: gimme100PLZ

### Did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?
- Based on my experience, I think MongoDB is extremely well-rounded. It has great documentation and it is a very popular database widely used in the industry. I was a little confused about how it worked at first but I was able to understand it in relatively short amount of time. I think it would surely be even less painful to use if I were to start a new project from scratch. Also I appreciate that all the data are on the cloud. I like it better than Firebase.
