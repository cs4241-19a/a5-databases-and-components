## a5-Alexander-Rus Music Web App

https://a5-alexander-rus.glitch.me

For this assignment I added a feature to my music saving web app that allows users to score individual songs. In the original application, users can create an account, login, add songs, delete songs, modify songs, and view their profile. I have now added a button on the home page that takes the client
to the rating page, where they can increment or decrement the score of each song as much as they like and remove songs all together.

For this project I used React to create the system that scores each song. I had to build a table, manage the state of the table, and add dynamic elements
all rendered using React. 

The new technology did improve the development experience, only after getting to know it. The inital part of learning the technology took some time and was a little frustrating, but once the project was started, it seemed to allow for a lot of dynamic changes. 

To see the React code, it is located in the 'contact.html' file. All the other files were from assignment 3 and don't contain any additional code.
