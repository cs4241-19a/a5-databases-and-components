I implemented mongoDB using mongoose. It was very simple to use and is more concrete in everyway. In the future I would rather use mongodb than storing in a JSON file or using lowdb. At first I tried to use mongodb without mongoose, and that proved to be much more painful. Mongoose simplified things and does a lot of the work for you.
