As a primarily backend coder, I chose to challege myself by implementing react for this assignment, it has become clear that this was a huge mistake.

I attempted to use react with my assignment 3 project. Although my assignment 3 still works, I could not get react to work. I was plauged by constant errors and issues I was unable to solve.

I found this project extremely frustrating as I spent days working on it and never got a working express/react framework working. I went through many tutorials and lost many hours of sleep attempting to do this project. The new technology hindered development by 100% it simply does not work.

I could never fix compilation errors with trying to run webpack.
