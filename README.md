## Inspira - A Web App for Storing Quotes!

Link: https://a5-jchengz.glitch.me/


**This is a rework of my A3 application to use MongoDB for the server to store the quotes.** Implementing MongoDB on the backend definitely made the development experience more interesting. This implementation improved the overall quality and robustness of the application, as it provides a better platform for handling changes and managing entries. This means that if the application was scaled upwards, the infrastructure for data storage and management would already exist. For the purposes of a small scale assignment, such an infrastructure is not really needed other than for proof of concept.

**Application Description**

The application itself allows the user to enter quotes and the author of quotes. There is a max of 20 characters for the authors name and
a max of 800 character for the quote. To access the application, you must use the google log-in **(yours, or slacked to the TAs from a3, or shown below)**. You will be able to view the quotes after logging in 
add your own quotes or edit any quotes. Shown in the table of quotes (See All Quotes) is the the author followed by the quote, followed by the number of words (wordcount) in the
quote. To "log out" close the window or hit the exit button.
