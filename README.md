## Bon Me Restaurant

http://a5-amandaeze97.glitch.me

This applcation is a replica of the famous Bon Me restaurant. However, this focuses on their delicious rice bowls. 
To place an order, the customer's first name, last name, and whatever they want to name their meal are required. 
Include a very brief summary of your project here. The name can be anything from Treasure Island to bon appetit. 
When the customer places their order, that order is them put under the "view orders" page with the other customer 
orders. 

This data is organized in a table where customers can modify or delete their orders. I incorporated MongoDB into
this functionality. MongoDB was much easier to use that lowdb, which I used in my previous assignment. The process
seemed more straightforward and gave me less of a headache to implement.

The functionality that works using MongoDB is that you can create an account and see that new account information 
in the console.
