I replaced lowDB with MongoDB in assignment 3 using Mongoose. Basic functionality remains the same. Since I felt that lowDB was easier than MongoDB to implement, I felt somewhat that it hindered the development experience. However, once I got over the learning curve, the ability to change the database remotely definitely improved the development experience.
