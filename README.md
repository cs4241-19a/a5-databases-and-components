## Changes:

To make the application work with react I added the react dev files from a cdn, and imported them via the html page. I then used to react to render the cards and apply the class and ids needed. However, I couldn't use the built in react event handlers becuase it interfered with the materialize animations and functionality. As a result using React greatly hindered the development expierence.
