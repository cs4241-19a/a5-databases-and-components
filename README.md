For this project, I simply updated my project 3 to use mongodb instead of lowdb. It's a prototype website for the WPI Magic: the Gathering Club to use to keep track of members.

Specifically for this project, I prefer lowdb to mongodb simply because the former is easier to use and modify due to everything being stored in a local file. mongodb is definitely more useful in general, though, and I'm glad I learned how to use it.
