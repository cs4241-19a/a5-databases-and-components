When I started this project at A3, I was already using MongoDB with Mongoose for authentication and data persistence. My initial attempt was to try creating a list app with data persistence using the entire MERN stack but I did not know React so I settled for EJS at the time. Now, we learned React so I tried small stuff like adding individual DOM elements instead of using create-react-app on the whole project. EJS and React do not necessarily cope well but I managed to insert two components and called small images/GIFs from those components.
