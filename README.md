Assignment 5 - Databases and/or Components
===

Deliverables
---
1) Implemented MongoDB - https://a5-arundelain-kroyer.glitch.me
2) Implemented React - https://arund-react-tic.glitch.me
3) Implemented Svelte - https://arund-quilt-svelte.glitch.me
5) A creative aspect with Processing - https://triangles-circles.glitch.me
4) All of these implementations can be access through the initial project (1) above.

In the gateway project a5-arundelain-kroyer.glitch.me I implemented a mongoDB database that does the following:
  -Takes in username and password data in the first two input slots. 
  -This data can be added to the database with the Add Data button.
  -The data is revealed on the page with the Show Data List button.
  
  -You can find the unique Id key in the Show Data List and use it 
    with the Delete Data button to delete a record from the data base.
  -You can use the same Id key to Update Data from the list - add the 
    updated data in the of Interest input slots then select the Update Data List
  -Remove Data clears the list from the page but not from the database.
  
  The links above the database slots take you to a Svelte implementation that
    is the beginning of a grammar based application for instructing quilters how to code - (Final Project)
  The React Tic Tac Toe implementation is also going to be part of the final project.
    The tic tac toe game was produced and fully commented by taking a tutorial. I will use this
    for people to create quilts. At this point it just outputs Xs and Os in the final project
    it will show the seam selection and grammar rules associated with a particular quilt block
  The Processing app is gravy...a fun little fidget.

All of the above was created in Glitch
