## Pythagorean Theorem Calculator

https://glitch.com/~a5-cenright1925 

This project allows the user to imput values for sides a and b of a right triangle and it will calculate side c. I used mongodb to store the results of the triangle . This technology hindered the development experience because unlike lowdb, I was unable to complete the delete functionality. The documentation online stated to use a line like `collection.find({"a" : input[i].a, "b" : input[i].b} ).limit(1)` to see if a given triangle was already stored in the database. However, I tried many different versions of this code based off of many different sources and I could not get it to work. In this case it would have been easier to stick with lowdb like for A3 because the it was much more straigtforward to work with.

Note:I talked to Professor Roberts and he said I could use my A2 as the basis for the assignment instead of A3 because my A3 was not functional.
