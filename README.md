**NOTE:** This will not display and I can't figure out why. I tried on both glitch and Heroku and neither will work. Both keep having errors and will not display or even deploy. I messaged the TA's, and they said it was okay to state my issues in the ReadMe and request my project be run locally, as it does work with the command "node server.js"

Compared to assignment 3, I changed the bet input to use Svelte. This function allows the user to select how much money they would like to bet on their guess being correct. Using Svelte is much simpler than the previous version using only HTML.

I update the performance log using React, which again takes less lines of code than before. Becuase I could not get MongoDB working, therefore there is no updating data displayed here. But the button does change to text when clicked, which utalizes React functionality.If the database were working, I would have been able to update this text to show the users previous guesses, bets, and current balance.

I changed lowDB to MongoDB. This was very difficult. The mongo hosting platform Atlas is extremely confusing and my website will not authenticate to the collection to it for some reason. In my experience SQL is much simplier and more straight forward.  Being unable to get MongoDb working correctly hindered my progress on other areas of this project.
