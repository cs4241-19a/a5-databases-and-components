## Horoscope Database V2

http://a5-nbloniarz.glitch.me

This is an expansion on a3 which was a website that allowed users to enter personal information into a database and generate their horoscope.

This project now includes a session timeout function run by React when users are logged into their account. The page times out after 20 seconds and logs the user out if they do not click Reset Timer before the timer expires.
