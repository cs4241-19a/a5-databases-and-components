Assignment 5 - Databases and/or Components
===

Due: October 7th, by 11:59 AM.

For this assignment you will complete one of the following tasks, based on your prior experience with the various technologies involved.

1. Rework the server component from Assignment #3 to use MongoDB or some other NoSQL database (like CouchDB). You can remove Passport authentication if you choose, although this might be as much work as simply changing your Passport calls to use MongoDB.
2. Rework the client component from Assignment #3 to use Svelte in some capacity.
3. Rework the client component from Assignmeent #3 to use React in some capacity.

For 2 and 3, make sure to look at [the notes from lecture 10](https://github.com/cs4241-19a/materials/blob/master/lecture10.markdown).

This is really a chance for you to experiment with some additional web technologies that the prior assignments haven't covered yet: non-flatfile databases and web component frameworks.

This project can be implemented on any hosting service (Glitch, DigitalOcean, Heroku etc.), however, you must include all files in your GitHub repo so that the course staff can view them; these files are not available for viewing in many hosting systems.
