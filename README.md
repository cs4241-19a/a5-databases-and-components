My hosting link: https://a5-dkaravoussianis-demi-karavoussianis.glitch.me/
Note: This will not display and I can't figure out why. I tried on both glitch and Heroku and neither will work. Both keep having errors and will not display or even deploy.

Compared to assignment 3 I changed lowDB to MongoDB. This was very difficult. The mongo hosting platform Atlas is extremely confusing and my website will not authenticate to it for some reason. In m experience SQL is much simplier and more straight forward.

I changed the bet input to use Svelte. This is much simpler than the previous version using only HTML.

I update the performance log using React, which again takes less lines of code than before. Becuase I could not get MongoDB working, therefore there is no data entry here. But the button does change to text when clicked, which utalizes React functionality.
