For this project, I used MongoDB as my primary method of data storage as opposed to LowDB which was used in Assignment 3.
I felt that MongoDB was actually easier to use than LowDB and would be my go-to method of database storage for the 
forseeable future. The setup was simple and I had no issues connecting to the database. The handling of database insert
requests was a bit tricky but could be picked up after a while.
