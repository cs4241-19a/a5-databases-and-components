In this assignment I got my A3 and used Svelte to render the front end. I took out the login functionality of the website because I used EJS and express layouts, which was not compatible with Svelte. I also removed saving shaders to a database (I was already using MongoDB for A3) and created a local storage of the shaders, and allowing to load previously saved shaders.
