## Power Monitoring Database with MongoDB

http://a5-danielcaffrey.glitch.me

I reworked my Assignment 3 to work with MongoDB. For simplicity, I removed the passport 
and cookie functionality. MongoDB initally hindered the development process, however I do think it is the better database option.
MongoDB's syntax for connecting and querying seemed much more complicated than that of lowdb at first.
However, once I learned the syntax, I felt that it was easy enough to use, and there seems to be much more in terms of advanced options for building your database.

For instructions on how to use the website, see my Assignment 3 submission.
