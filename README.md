For project a5, I added svelte to my project a3. I decided to use svelte because it helped cleanly optimize my project (as well as the fact that it's not run by Facebook). My a3 was incomplete, so I had to do more work on making a3 functional. Resulting as such, I wasn't able to do much more than just implement svelte into the base project.

Thank you so much for an enjoyable class. While I was often busy with overloads and would put some work on the backburner, I feel like I learned a lot about being a full stack developer and the fun work that can be done as one.
