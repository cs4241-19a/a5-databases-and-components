## House Job Tracker (Now with MongoDB)

For this assignment, I replaced the implementation of lowDB in assignment #3 with a new implementation of MongoDB. I elected to remove user authentication due to how I utilized the users/passport when I originally wrote assignment #3.

Adding MongoDB assisted in my development process because it is something I have wanted to learn how to use since my summer internship. Many of my coworkers had used it on both personal and company projects, and said that it was a very useful method for storing persistant data in the cloud. I have wanted to be able to host my own data in the cloud for a while, as well as potentially implement MongoDB into my final project.
