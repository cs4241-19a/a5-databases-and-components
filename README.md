I converted my database to use MongoDB using Mongoose. I think the code is a lot cleaner and shorter with mongo/mongoose.
I'm also better at promises now but mongo is a lot less complicated and simpler. 
One downside, which might just be from not doing enough research, is that I couldn't find a way to increment a 
value in the database without solving the possibility of a race condition. My previous db had a simple way to do it and I miss it.
