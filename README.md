A5 - Databases and components

https://jharnois4512-a5-databases-and-components.glitch.me

Used MongoDB as my database client. A change from LowDB.  Still a bit shaky. Need to hit the submit button twice to refresh page at times.  Makes 2 versions of the entry. But it works.
It makes things a lot easier.  Using mongodb allows for an easier flow in the code for a database.  Overall much better than lowdb.  The connection and writing are also much easier.
