MongoDB has been applied to store the user-password-carInfoSets. The MongoDB apperantly experiences lag whenever there are changes made to the data, so that the user has to refresh every time after update/delete/add is done. But overall MongoDB is a plus because it has greater accessiblity and space, and the data is cloud-based therefore permenate.
