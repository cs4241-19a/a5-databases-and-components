## Destination Locations

My project is a site where users can go to post about their experiences with different vacation destinations. Users can create an account and add their own reviews of destinations. They can also view a list of all of the destinations posted by all users so that they can learn about other people's experiences as well. Users can see who posted which destination and what they reviewed it on a scale from 1 to 5. The list is filtered so that each destination posted by the user currently logged in has two buttons below it. These buttons allow the user to modify or remove from their destinations in the database and not from destinations posted by other users (with the exception of the admin account).

Added to this assignment was the usage of MongoDB instead of lowdb. My Mongo database has two collections, users and sites, where data is stored for those things. The program runs and works exactly the same as before but now it stores data differently. This did not really improve the experience/efficiency but it did not hinder it either. I believe that if I was storing a lot more data in a lot more collections then it would be MUCH more useful, but for my particular assignment it really didn't make much of a difference.
