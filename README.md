I implemented an incredibly better version of my project 3 with svelte js. I managed to incorporate some interesting components in my client side.
The server works the same as before, it can store usernames and passwords but lacks a submit function for new entries.

NOTE: I could not figure out for the life of me on how to get my svelte app to run on glitch.

Please, if you wish to run the app, clone the repo, then cd into the /svelte-app folder
Run: npm run dev
Then run: node ./public/server.js

I apologize, but I really couldn't understand what glitch was doing.
