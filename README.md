This app collects facts and jokes for the entertainment of all! This updated version replaces lowdb with MongoDB (for content storage as well as authentication).
Learning the new, more complex database API hindered the development experience, but it was for the best! The hindrance was 
only in learning to use the MongoDB API (mostly because I hadn't fully grasped the ways of promises yet). Once I learned got the hang of it,
writing additional database functions was quick. The MongoDB API is more complex than lowdb, but more capable, the the DBMS backing the app 
is a much more powerful and flexible solution.
