I added React to my a3 project. In a3, I had an html page for login and for the main index. Here, I keep the same structure, with one html for login and one for main. I wrote two components, one to render the login page and the other to render the main page. I think using React enhances the project, but it would have been better to start from the ground up with React. I would have made components of finer granularity - each text input could be it's own component that accepts props, for example. But for this case it was just easier to keep larger chunks in components, especially because I already had the logic figured out. I think styling would be easier with React's styling or with Material UI, but I kept the styles I had from a3 in this case. One place where it hinders development is the actual server/hosting. In a serious production level React app, hosting requires a lot of special care, many Node libraries, and a lot of overhead. Here, I just built manually into the 'dist' folder, and I statically host that with my server. This is not the ideal preferred method for hosting React apps but for this application it works fine.
