## Horoscope Database V2

http://a5-nbloniarz.glitch.me

This is an expansion on a3 which was a website that allowed users to enter personal information into a database and generate their horoscope.

This project now includes a session timeout function run by React when users are logged into their account. The page times out after 20 seconds.

Using React made this more difficult because it required fitting React into an existing prohect rather than starting from scratch. Although annpying to step up, once working react made it easier to add html elements to the page.

Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer hte folloiwn question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

Unlike previous assignments, this assignment will be solely graded on whether or not you successfully complete it. Partial credit will be generously given.
