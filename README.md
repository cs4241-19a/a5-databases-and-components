## Bookmarker - MongoDB

http://a5-jpinz.glitch.me

I updated my bookmarker tool to use mongodb as a database provider instead of lowdb. I still used passport for authentication. Similar to my a3, sign up and then go to the login page to login with those credentials, then hit the bookmarker header to go home and it should be logged in.

Using this new technology I don't think changed anything about the development process. **I managed to swap from LowDB to MongoDB in less than 9 hours**.

It was convenient to not have to change any of the website javascript and only changed the server hosting logic.

LowDB was nice because it's as simple as accessing a json file. But MongoDB is cool because I can tell there is a lot of expanding that can be done with it. LowDB is definitely limiting for a lot of things, and MongoDB is much more scalable, especially with table support.
