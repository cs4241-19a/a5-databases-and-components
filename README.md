I changed my project to use MongoDB. I took a while figuring it out, but in the end I think it was better/more elegant to use MongoDB rather than lowdb. Also, I added polyfill to my project to made it cross-browser safe: the custom elements of nes.css (like dialog) are only natively supported by Chrome. I added this so other browsers could run my game.
