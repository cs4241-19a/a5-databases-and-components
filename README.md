## Standard Teacher's Roster

https://a5-pllopez.glitch.me

Based on my experience with creating math problems and designs for mathspring.org, an intelligent tutoring system, 
I decided to create a login page and roster for a set of teachers. Assignment 5 is an alteration of my original idea that includes ReactJS components. Having experience in ReactJS, I didn't have any trouble in restructuring my previous work; however, only having developed single page applications before, I had some trouble linking each page to each other. I did some research into React Router and attempted to apply it to my own work, but I had some difficulties. I was able to successfully refactor the login page, and I even restructured the home.js file (though one cannot reach it due to the lack of linked pages). Though the React Router components appeared to somewhat work, no matter the way I structured my code and files, the next page would not properly load. 

Perhaps if I had more time to devote to this project, ReactJS would be a better fit. As of right now, it has only hindered the usability of the application by making it essentially useless. If transitioning between pages hadn't been an issue, ReactJS would have removed the need for much of the JQuery, allowing the components to be much easier to remove and add in the roster.  ReactJS would also remove the need for the separate html and javascript files, allowing the code to be refactored into one file. This technology has the potential to make this project much easier, but the difficulties in creating multiple pages caused it to be a hindrance.
