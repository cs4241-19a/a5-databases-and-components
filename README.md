## Inventory Manager

This project allows user to maintain an inventory of items that they add, edit, and remove themselves. The only thing that has changed is that instead of using the sequelize framework and SQLite, the website is now using MongoDB. 
Did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?
The new technology added did not really improve or hinder the development experience. It worked very similarly to the Sequelize framework that I had used before so I only really had to change the initial setup and the model. Honestly though, I kind of liked the original Sequelize framework better because I felt like I understood more of how it worked but the MongoDB is also pretty good because it is a cloud database hosted in a new cluster rather than just a file within the file system.
