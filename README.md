### Brief Summary of My Project:

The website allows dogs owners to book pampering sessions for their dogs. They can add, edit, and delete bookings and customize their order to their satisfaction.

### What I Changed and Added To Assignment 3:

I used react and added four functions(Hello, Instructions, Massage, and LargerDogFee) that extend React.Component. These four functions output the four parts of the instructions so that users can understand how to customize their dog's pampering session and fill out the booking form.

### Did The New Technology Improve or Hinder The Development Experience:

The new technology was able to improve the development experience since react was able to make code more modular. I was able to divide the four components of the instructions into multiple functions, and I now have the abilty to easily call any function again whenever I want to reuse code. In addition, breaking the code into functions made the code more readable, since each function/function name defines the purpose of its particular part of the instructions. 

For ex: the function Massage help other developers understand that it tackles the massage-related portion of the instructions.

So react made it easier to reuse and document my code. It is easier for others to read and understand my code as well.
