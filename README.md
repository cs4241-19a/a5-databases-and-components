I didn't change quite much to be honest. I just removed the passport authentication and added in MongoDB capabilities.
It's still the same as my A3; 

This webapp was inspired by the restaurant that I have been working at for 3 years. 
No other type of database would I be more familiar with than a food system.
The way the app works is that you type in your information and choose what fish you'd like, how you'd like to have it,
and of course how much you'd like. After hitting submit, you'll be brought to the All Orders screen which show you all orders


It'll show all orders, modify and delete based on their MongoDB IDs.

It didn't make my life easier as I needed to convert over to MongoDB. However, if I were to have started
with Mongo, it would probably made it easier than lowDB as the calls were much more efficient and easier to figure out.
Needless to say, i didn't implement specific searches but rather took everything from the DB into an array, so it may actually
be just as difficult.
