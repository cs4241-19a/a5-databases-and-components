## Andrew's Arbitrary Information Collection Station Version 3

https://a5-acnolan.glitch.me/

This app is an upgraded version of assignment, which was an upgraded version of assignment 3.
### Now it uses MongoDB!!
This application takes your data in a form and then creates "interesting" statistics based on what other users have submitted.
These stats include:

- total number of users in the database
- average name
- average length of name
- average user age
- average favorite color
- average mood while filling out the form
Each user is linked to their own set of data so you cannot modify another users data. 
However, you can edit your own submissions.

Currently one user exists in the system already:
  user: admin
  password: admin
  
Feel free to test with that account and/or make your own. 
The data gets more fun the more users there are.


Adding MongoDB was beneficial to the development process.
On the original assignment implementing the database was 
the biggest challenge for me. For this assignment it was
the only task so I guess it was also the hardest. But,
I felt like I could do it well, and the MondoDB atlas
site was very helpful for managing the database as opposed
to doing weird stuff with lowDB in the command line. I
think I like Mongo more than lowDB. So the development 
process was nicer.

I was able to test the site in chrome and firefox, it
works in both places.
