**Summary of Project**
The project allows a user to input a random number of points, a random number of triangles, and a name. It would then generate a random 3D object on the canvas using WebGL. The 3D object is generated by random generating point coordinates and randomly assigning points to form a triangle. The user can also translate and rotate the object in space using these keys !, @, #, $, %, ^, &.

**What was changed
I added two react components to display the project title and instructions and used webpack to bundle up the files.

**New Technology Improve or Hinder
The new technology did improve the development experience. React allows for more modular code which helps a lot with orginazation.
