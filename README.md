I used FireBase realtime database for this project. Using a nosql database is really useful as you can work in JSONs and since my project was structured in a way that I needed
nested JSONs, Firebase was very helpful. Also the use of the realtime database is very useful too as I can watch the data get updated in real time and can also interact with the
nested JSON data on the cloud.
