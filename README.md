For this assignment I reworked the main page of my a3 application to use svelte instead of using jquery/js to modify
 the DOM. I think svelte definitely made creating the website easier because I had a lot of DOM modification when a
  user searches and the table needs to be populated. With svelte, I can just use an `{:each}` block to dynamically
   generate the html. In addition, the ability to use variables in the html code is a really cool feature that makes
    changing classes super easer.
