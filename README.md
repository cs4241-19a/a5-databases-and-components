In assignment 3, I used lowdb, so for this assignment I decided to implement MongoDB in its place. Implementing MongoDB into the code was not too hard, however the actual set up of MongoDB was where I struggled. Creating users and giving them access to the collections was where most of my issues arrose. The documentation for MongoDB is not the greatest and only added to the problems that I had during this assignment.

Overall, I enjoy how MongoDB has different security levels including read or write or both. I think it is a a secure database that has a lot of advantages.
