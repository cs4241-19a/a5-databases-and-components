## Pirate Crew Generator

https://a5-brian-earl.glitch.me/

For this project I implemented MongoDB into my pirate crew generator project to handle the database of pirates for the crew. Overall, the new technology improved the development experince since in my original project I didn't use any sort of database and had to store everthing in a .JSON file and parse everything manually. Adding MongoDB really makes it easier to not only store and receive all of the pirates, but also add, remove and modify them as well.
