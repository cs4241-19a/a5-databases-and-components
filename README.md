## Pizza Ordering Website

My website allows you to order pizza from Classic Pizza, allowing up to two toppings per pizza. 
You can order a new pizza, see your orders currently being worked on, edit them, and delete them.
Click on the "View Current Orders" link to see the table of current orders, and click on the "Order now!"
link to bring back up the form to order a new pizza.

**You now must use the username: jarod and the password: hello to login. No new users can be added.**

I replaced my lowdb server with a mongodb server. I think both types of servers have their pros and cons in
terms of the development experience. There doesn't seem to be a lot of documentation on either of them, and
in my opinion, both can be tricky in terms of accessing the necessary data. Overall, I understand the advantages
of being much more secure and hosting information where people cannot alter it with mongodb, but in terms of the 
development experience, using lowdb is simpler since you have direct access to the .json file you are altering.
